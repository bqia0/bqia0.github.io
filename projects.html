            <p>
                Over the years, I've felt the need to actually do something interesting with the very costly education I was getting. So, I tried to devote as much time
                as classes would allow to a few small projects. Some of these ended up being great for talking to employers.

                        This was a project a <a href="https://github.com/Tarokan" target="_blank">friend </a> and I did for personal amusement.
                        We created a simulator to run a RISCV program from an assembly file. You can step through a file instruction by instruction, set breakpoints,
                        and view registers. We also included an assembler to convert from assembly to RISCV machine code.

                    <p> 
                        This project was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim" target="_blank">Spike </a>, but is far less functional
                        and lacks many of <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim" target="_blank">Spike's </a> impressive features.

                        This was a project a <a href="https://github.com/icarusoars" target="_blank">partner </a> and I did for a digital design class.
                        It would track the path of a laser pointer on a wall and draw the path to a screen. 
                        We uploaded our design to a DE2-115 FPGA with an attachable camera. The FPGA displayed output to a VGA monitor. We implemented logic
                        for laser tracking, drawing to memory, and controlling the VGA display in Verilog.
